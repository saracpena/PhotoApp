Deployments Firebase check SDK and Heroku are running into issues:
    # https://photo-app-clone.web.app/

    # https://fotoapp.herokuapp.com/

Error: Target container is not a DOM element.

# Unlike feature is NOT disappearing on the spot within 'My Likes', address this asap

# Like feature is working well and appears on all User accounts
    • ADD feature to render WHO liked that post
    • Why? Because the "like" shows up on every user's account whether they
    liked it or not.

    ****CORRECTION, after reengaging with the app, it appears that Likes are rendering
    as they should!
 # LIKE BUG!
    • Likes from other users are rendering in 'My Likes" on other user accounts!
    • Likes should only render on 'My Likes' for those who liked it!
    • Add KEY prop? UID prop? Must make the "Like" UNIQUE to the "Liker"

# Still pending: the DeleteUser feature

    ######I SWAPPED FILES OF TWO DIFFERENT APPS THINKING IT WOULD BE OKAY, NOT! 
••••I originally created a REPO on GitHub for this PhotoApp project which I then cloned so that it
would show up locally onto my DESKTOP. Over time, I decided to scrap my original 'project' and pursue
a SocialMedia clone where I then created a NEW APP 'photo-app-clone' via create-react-app and used 
the same naming convention on Firebase-google db. 
***OKAY...here comes the kicker....****
    • Instead of 'uploading' photo-clone-app to my GitHub repo, I thought it would be easier to swap the files
    from PhotoApp and photo-clone-app. HUGE MISTAKE! 
    • EVEN THOUGH I had swapped these files meticulously,
        #1 PhotoApp did NOT recognize all the installations I had originally made in 'photo-app-clone'
            •So, I had to "re" install:
                 -Firebase: npm install --save firebase (which allows me to properly host!, it wasn't before)
                 -React Dom: npm install react react-dom
                 -Material UI: npm install @material-ui/core & npm install @material-ui/icons
                 -npm i -S react-flip-move (which is my posts animation)
                 -Redux Toolkit (which handles functions like createSlice)
            these installs only lived inside 'photo-app-clone', NOT PhotoApp. So, my files were not compiled because
            of missing installations.
        #2 I received "Error: Target container is not a DOM element.". So, I had to sift through 3 different index.html files and make sure my DOM was properly setup to the correct one.
        • I'm not sure why I have 3 index.html but,
            1. build > index.html
            2. i > index.html
            3. public > index.html
        • After changing each index.html's <div id=''> from 'message' to 'root' to match getElementById('root')
        it turned out that it was public > index.html that fixed the issue.
