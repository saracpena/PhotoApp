1. Why is my api showing up in <header> instead of body?
2. How to auto render pictures in "photos" nav bar link with date uploaded, num of likes,
Retrieve photo dates from API 

REDUX:
    Actions Folder
        • add pictures
        • delete pictures
        • like/unlike pictures
        • post/delete comments
        • 
    Reducers Folder
        • include a fail-safe default: return state

    dispatch() will be called in components

// Photos.js (page)/Pictures.js(component) currently rendering outside of of 'body', create some container to keep it inside profile body

default: return state; keeps our code from "blowing up"
